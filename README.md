# To-do-list-maker
Automated to do lists


This script generates a weekly To-Do list in RTF format. It does the following:

Filename Creation: It creates a filename based on the current week's starting date (Monday) and the week number of the year, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD_WeekXX.rtf.

Content Generation: It generates RTF content with a standard To-Do list layout, including placeholders for tasks.

File Creation: It ensures the target directory exists, constructs the full file path, and writes the RTF content to the specified file.

Execution: When run, the script creates the RTF file in the defined directory and confirms the creation.
